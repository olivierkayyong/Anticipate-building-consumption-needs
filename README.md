# Anticipate building consumption needs
You work for the city of Seattle. To achieve its goal of a carbon-neutral city by 2050, your team is taking a close look at the consumption and emissions of non-residential buildings.

Careful surveys were carried out by city officials in 2016. Here are the data: https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy.
However, these readings are expensive to obtain, and from those already taken, 
you want to try to predict the CO2 emissions and the total energy consumption of non-residential buildings for which they have not yet been measured.

You are also looking to assess the value of the "ENERGY STAR Score" for predicting emissions, which is tedious to calculate with the approach currently used by your team. You will integrate it into the modeling and judge its interest.

## Your mission:

Carry out a short exploratory analysis.
Test different prediction models in order to answer the problem.
